You have a single binary application that you want to run on Google Cloud Platform. You decided to automatically scale the application based on underlying infrastructure CPU usage. Your organizational policies require you to use virtual machines directly. You need to ensure that the application scaling is operationally efficient and completed as quickly as possible. What should you do?
Create a Google Kubernetes Engine cluster, and use horizontal pod autoscaling to scale the application.
Create an instance template, and use the template in a managed instance group with autoscaling configured.
Create an instance template, and use the template in a managed instance group that scales up and down based on the time of day.
Use a set of third-party tools to build automation around scaling the application up and down, based on Stackdriver CPU usage monitoring.
