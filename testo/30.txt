You are creating a Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) cluster with a cluster autoscaler feature enabled. You need to make sure that each node of the cluster will run a monitoring pod that sends container metrics to a third-party monitoring solution. What should you do?
Deploy the monitoring pod in a StatefulSet object.
Deploy the monitoring pod in a DaemonSet object.
Reference the monitoring pod in a Deployment object.
Reference the monitoring pod in a cluster initializer at the GKE cluster creation time.
