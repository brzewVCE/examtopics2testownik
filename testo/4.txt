Your organization has a new security requirement around data exfiltration on iOS devices. You have a requirement to prevent users from copying content from a Google app (Gmail, Drive, Docs, Sheets, and Slides) in their work account to a Google app in their personal account or a third-party app. What steps should you take from the admin panel to prevent users from copying data from work to non-work apps on iOS devices?
Navigate to “Data Protection” setting in Google Admin Console's Device management section and disable the “Allow users to copy data to personal apps” checkbox.
Disable “Open Docs in Unmanaged Apps” setting in Google Admin Console’s Device management section.
Navigate to Devices > Mobile and endpoints > Universal Settings > General and turn on Basic Mobile Management.
Clear the “Allow items created with managed apps to open in unmanaged apps” checkbox.
