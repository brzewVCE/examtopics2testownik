You created a Google Cloud Platform project with an App Engine application inside the project. You initially configured the application to be served from the us- central region. Now you want the application to be served from the asia-northeast1 region. What should you do?
Change the default region property setting in the existing GCP project to asia-northeast1.
Change the region property setting in the existing App Engine application from us-central to asia-northeast1.
Create a second App Engine application in the existing GCP project and specify asia-northeast1 as the region to serve your application.
Create a new GCP project and create an App Engine application inside this new project. Specify asia-northeast1 as the region to serve your application.
